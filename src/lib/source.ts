	 * **Opt-in optimization** — when supplied, the session treats this as the
	 * authoritative dependency set for the file and skips its own lex+resolve
	 * pass for this entry. Build-tool integrations (e.g., Gro's filer) that
	 * already maintain a dependency graph can hand it over directly instead of
	 * paying the lex+resolve cost twice.
	 *
	 * **Omit (undefined) → default behavior** — the session lexes import
	 * specifiers from `content` and resolves them via its `ImportResolver`.
	 * This is the right choice when the caller doesn't already have a graph.
	 *
	 * Only include resolved local imports — node_modules paths are filtered
	 * out at storage time by the configured `isSource` predicate either way.
	 *
	 * **Trust contract** — the session treats this array as authoritative and
	 * does not cross-check against the file's `content`. Edges declared here
	 * are accepted as-is, even if the source code doesn't actually import them;
	 * edges that *are* in `content` but missing from this array are silently
	 * omitted. The lex+resolve fallback path has no such hole — its edges are
	 * always grounded in syntactic imports. Build-tool integrations that
	 * supply this field own the correctness of the graph they hand over.
	 *
	 * Type-only imports (`import type {...}`) are the most common asymmetry
	 * versus the lex+resolve path: the default lex (`es-module-lexer`) keeps
	 * them; pre-resolved callers backed by a Gro-style filer typically drop
	 * them. Both are intentional within their respective contracts.
	 *
	 * Cache semantics: the session compares this array element-wise (shallow
	 * equality) against the snapshot stored from the prior call — a fresh
	 * array with identical contents cache-hits, while any length, element, or
	 * order difference invalidates. Callers that produce fresh arrays per
	 * call (e.g., Gro's `[...filer.dependencies.keys()]`) reuse the cache
	 * cleanly across persistent-session calls.
	 *
	 * Order is significant. Reordering without a content change is treated
	 * as a real change — sort upstream if you want order-insensitive caching.
	 * Map-iteration-order callers (e.g., a Gro filer emitting
	 * `[...filer.dependencies.keys()]`) are naturally stable across calls for
	 * the same content, so no defensive sort is needed there.
